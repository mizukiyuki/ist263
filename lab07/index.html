    <h1 class="special">Yuki Jiang's Biography</h1>
    <p>Hi I’m Yifei Jiang and I also go by Yuki. As a senior majoring in iSchool, I have really good experiences with skills of information studies such as <strong>SQL, Vertabelo, and Python</strong>.</p>
    <p>Broadcast & Digital Journalism is my other major, which taught me how to conduct interviews, be a good listener and storyteller as well as collaborate with co-workers.</p> 
    <p>Here’s a secret: If you like video games as well, please feel free to contact me and you’ll get a good teammate!</p>
    
    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>I like listening to music. I also like video games and I play it with my roommate almost every night. Besides, I like traveling and I have travelled to many countries such as Britain and Singapore. The most recent place that I travelled to is Peurto Rico. I like taking photos during traveling as well, which can help me to memorize what I have ever encountered.</p>
