        Hi there! I’m Yifei Jiang and I also go by Yuki. As a senior majoring in iSchool, I have really good experiences with skills of information studies such as SQL, Vertabelo, and Python. Broadcast & Digital Journalism is my other major, which taught me how to conduct interviews, be a good listener and storyteller as well as collaborate with co-workers. Here’s a secret: If you like video games as well, please feel free to contact me and you’ll get a good teammate!
