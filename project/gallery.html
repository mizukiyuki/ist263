            <div><p>Puerto Rico was where I went during Thanksgiving break. I really like the weather, colorful buildings, and tasty ice creams there. Puerto Rico offers the perfect balance between tranquil retreat and rum-soaked nightlife. As far as beaches go, it doesn’t get better than the sands of Isla de Vieques—particularly Mosquito Bay, where by moonlight the water glows blue-green thanks to bioluminescent microorganisms. When I posted my photos on Instagram, someone asked me if it was Spain. They does look similar.</p></div>
