            <div><p>Puerto Rico was where I went during Thanksgiving break. I really like the weather, colorful buildings, and tasty ice creams there. Puerto Rico offers the perfect balance between tranquil retreat and rum-soaked nightlife. As far as beaches go, it doesn’t get better than the sands of Isla de Vieques—particularly Mosquito Bay, where by moonlight the water glows blue-green thanks to bioluminescent microorganisms. When I posted my photos on Instagram, someone asked me if it was Spain. They does look similar.</p></div>

            <div><p>There was another group of people on the boat with us. Maybe they were little nuns from The Sound of Music. When the boat turned a corner and lost the shade of greenery, the sun came straight in, and they stretched out their hands to block it. In the distant light, they were all bright.</p></div>

            <div><p>River Walk was where I felt the most romance concentrated. The moment I got off the boat and stepped onto the stony ground, all the romance within me was awakened. I thought of the person who haunts me in my dreams. I wanted to take his hand and walk between the taverns on the banks of the river, as if running in the fields in August, free, peaceful, excited, and some other feelings that wanted to share.</p></div>

            <div><p>"我常觉得这古园有着宿命的味道：仿佛它就是为了等我，而历尽沧桑在那里等了四百多年。四百多年里，它一面剥离了古殿檐头浮夸的琉璃，淡退了门璧上炫耀的朱红，坍圮了一段段高墙又散落了玉砌雕栏，祭坛四周的老柏树愈渐苍幽，到处的野草荒藤也都茂盛得自在坦荡。在满园弥漫的沉静光芒中，一个人更容易看到时间，并看到自己的身影。"————史铁生《我与地坛》</p></div>
            <div><p>‘I often feel that this ancient garden has a sense of destiny: as if it was just to wait for me, and it has been waiting there for more than 400 years through vicissitudes. Within the 400 years, it stripped off the exaggerated glaze on the eaves of the ancient temples, faded the vermilion that was showing off on the door wall and collapsed sections of high walls and scattered jade fences. The old cypress trees around the altar are getting darker. Weeds and vines that can be seen everywhere also becomes magnanimously lush. In the quiet light that fills the garden, it is easier for a person to see the time and her true self.'--Tiesheng Shi[Myself and Earth-God Altar]</p></div>

            <div><p>最初对这个地方产生好奇，是因为一个人。那时的我以为，他和别人都不一样。如同落入凡间的仙，剑眉星眸，言笑晏晏；胸中有丘壑，眉目有星河；羽衣常染烟霞色，不惹人间桃李香。我用以形容他的词句太多太多，于是我特意来到这里圣地巡礼。我在他的履痕上探寻，仙子究竟生长在怎样的仙境中。虽然最后我发现，一切都是璨焕的虚影。临走时我在心里对自己说：花是昨日之花，你的梦是少年之梦。花开的时候再会吧。</p></div>
            <div><p>I was initially curious about this place because of a special person. At the time, I thought he was different from anyone else. Like a fairy who has fallen into the mundane world. There are too many words to describe him, so I came here to visit, trying to find out what kind of fairyland the fairy grew up in. Although in the end I found out that everything was just an illusion. Before leaving, I said to myself: flower is yesterday's flower; your dream is a future dream. See you when the flowers bloom.</p></div>
